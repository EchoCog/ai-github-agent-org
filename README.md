# GitHub AI Agent

An intelligent AI agent that can interact with GitHub repositories through natural language commands. Built with
LangGraph and OpenAI, this tool allows you to create pull requests, list branches, and perform other GitHub operations
using conversational AI.

## Features

- ü§ñ **Natural Language Interface**: Interact with GitHub using plain English commands
- üîß **Pull Request Creation**: Automatically create PRs with custom titles, descriptions, and branch configurations
- üåø **Branch Management**: List and manage repository branches, including filtering for open branches
- üîó **GitHub API Integration**: Full integration with GitHub's REST API
- ‚ö° **LangGraph Powered**: Built on LangGraph for robust AI workflow management
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
- üîå **Extensible**: Easy to add new GitHub operations and tools
- üí¨ **Conversational Context**: Maintains context across multiple interactions for a more natural experience

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- GitHub Personal Access Token
- OpenAI API Key
- Git (for version control)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd github-ai-agent
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**

   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_personal_access_token_here
   ```

## Configuration

### GitHub Personal Access Token

1. Go to GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Select the following scopes:
    - `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
    - `public_repo` (Access public repositories)
4. Copy the generated token and add it to your `.env` file

### OpenAI API Key

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Create a new API key
3. Add it to your `.env` file

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

Run the tool in interactive mode:

```bash
python main.py
```

You'll see a welcome message and can start interacting with the agent:

```
Hey! How can I help you today?
You can ask me to:
  - Create a PR (e.g., 'create me a PR in the repo my-org/my-repo from branch feature-x to main')
  - List branches (e.g., 'list all open branches in my-org/my-repo')
Type 'exit' or 'quit' to end the conversation.

> list all open branches in my-org/my-repo
Response: I'll list all the open branches in my-org/my-repo...

> create me a PR from feature-x to main
Response: I'll create a pull request from feature-x to main...
```

### Command Examples

#### Creating a Pull Request

```bash
> create me a PR in myuser/my-project from branch 'feature/auth' to 'develop'
```

#### Listing Branches

```bash
> list all branches in myuser/my-project
```

#### Listing Only Open Branches

```bash
> list all open branches in myuser/my-project
```

### Context Awareness

The agent maintains context across multiple interactions. For example:

```bash
> list branches in my-org/my-repo
Response: Here are the branches: ...

> create a PR from feature-x to main
Response: Creating PR from feature-x to main...
```

Notice that in the second command, we didn't need to specify the repository again because the agent remembered it from the previous interaction.

## Dependencies

```txt
langgraph>=0.0.40
langchain-core>=0.1.40
langchain-openai>=0.1.0
requests>=2.31.0
python-dotenv>=1.0.0
```

## Available Tools

### `create_github_pull_request`

Creates a new pull request in a GitHub repository.

**Parameters:**

- `repo_owner` (str): GitHub username or organization
- `repo_name` (str): Repository name
- `title` (str): Pull request title
- `body` (str): Pull request description
- `head_branch` (str): Source branch to merge from
- `base_branch` (str): Target branch to merge into (default: "main")

### `list_github_branches`

Lists all branches in a GitHub repository.

**Parameters:**

- `repo_owner` (str): GitHub username or organization
- `repo_name` (str): Repository name
- `open_only` (bool): If True, only return branches that have open pull requests

## Error Handling

The agent includes comprehensive error handling for common scenarios:

- **Invalid credentials**: Clear feedback when GitHub token is missing or invalid
- **Repository not found**: Helpful error messages for non-existent repositories
- **Permission issues**: Guidance when lacking necessary repository permissions
- **Network errors**: Retry suggestions for connectivity issues
- **API rate limits**: Information about GitHub API limits

## Extending the Agent

### Adding New Tools

To add new GitHub operations, create a new tool function:

```python
@tool
def create_github_issue(
    repo_owner: str,
    repo_name: str,
    title: str,
    body: str,
    labels: List[str] = None
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """Create a new GitHub issue."""
    # Implementation here
    pass


# Add to the tools list in GitHubAgent.__init__
self.tools = [create_github_pull_request, list_github_branches, create_github_issue]
```

### Customizing the LLM

You can customize the language model settings:

```python
self.llm = ChatOpenAI(
    model="gpt-4",  # or "gpt-3.5-turbo"
    temperature=0,  # Adjust for creativity vs consistency
    max_tokens=1000  # Control response length
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"GitHub token not configured"**

- Ensure your `.env` file contains a valid `GITHUB_TOKEN`
- Check that the token has the necessary permissions

**"Failed to create PR: 422"**

- Verify the source and target branches exist
- Ensure you have write access to the repository
- Check that a PR between these branches doesn't already exist

**"Request failed: Connection error"**

- Check your internet connection
- Verify GitHub's API status at [githubstatus.com](https://githubstatus.com)

**OpenAI API errors**

- Verify your OpenAI API key is valid and has sufficient credits
- Check the model name is correct (e.g., "gpt-4" vs "gpt-3.5-turbo")

### Debug Mode

Enable verbose logging by setting the environment variable:

```bash
export LANGCHAIN_VERBOSE=true
```

## Security Considerations

- **Never commit your `.env` file** - Add it to `.gitignore`
- **Use minimal permissions** - Grant only necessary GitHub token scopes
- **Rotate tokens regularly** - GitHub tokens should be rotated periodically
- **Validate inputs** - The agent includes input validation, but always verify in production
