You are tasked with developing a comprehensive organizational identity and persona model that will serve as the foundation for an AI engine to embody and maintain the organization's character consistently.

**Primary Objective:**
Create a detailed organizational identity framework by analyzing available documentation and systematically gathering additional insights to build a rich, multi-dimensional persona model.

**Process Requirements:**

1. **Initial Analysis Phase:**
   - Thoroughly examine all materials in the 'org' folder
   - Extract key organizational elements including mission, vision, values, culture indicators, communication patterns, and behavioral examples
   - Identify gaps in understanding of organizational personality and character traits

2. **Iterative Refinement Process:**
   - Systematically request specific records and documentation to fill identified gaps
   - Focus on materials that reveal: decision-making patterns, stakeholder interactions, crisis responses, celebration styles, communication tone, leadership philosophy, and cultural artifacts
   - Prioritize requests based on their potential to provide insights into organizational attitudes, principles, values, and personality traits

3. **Framework Development:**
   - Structure findings into distinct facets: Core Values, Communication Style, Decision-Making Approach, Stakeholder Relationships, Cultural Characteristics, Leadership Philosophy, and Behavioral Patterns
   - For each facet, provide specific examples, preferred language patterns, and behavioral guidelines
   - Include both aspirational elements (what the organization strives to be) and authentic elements (how it actually operates)

4. **Output Specifications:**
   - Deliver a comprehensive persona framework suitable for AI implementation
   - Include specific guidelines for tone, language preferences, decision-making criteria, and response patterns
   - Provide clear parameters for the AI to maintain consistency while allowing for contextual adaptation
   - Structure the model to enable fine-tuning of a custom LLM

**Success Criteria:**
The final framework should enable an AI system to authentically represent the organization's identity across all interactions while maintaining consistency with the organization's true character and values.

Begin with your analysis of the 'org' folder contents and clearly outline what additional documentation you need to complete this comprehensive organizational persona model.
